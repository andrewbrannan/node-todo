[X] Move the query strings right into their function calls
[X] Decouple the database calls and the CLI API
[ ] Use logical numbering on task list
[x] Switch to using promises
[ ] Write some tests

the db module should also return promises that so that the application can decide what to
do on success/failure of adding rows to the database.
What should I return if there's a user error, for example they try to delete a
row that doesn't exist?

database calls:
addTask(task) - task -> string of the text of the task to add
listTasks() - gets an array of all current tasks and their status
deleteTask(idToDelete) - deletes the task with the give id
completeTask(idToComplete) - marks the task as completed
